## Substitution Cipher

The Substitution Cipher is a method of encryption where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with another letter according to a fixed system. This repository provides implementations of different types of substitution ciphers, such as Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, Polyalphabetic Cipher, and Key-Based Substitution.

## RSA Algorithm
The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Algorithm is a widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm for secure data transmission. It utilizes the mathematical properties of prime numbers to generate public and private keys for encryption and decryption.
